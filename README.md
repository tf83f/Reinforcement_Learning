# Reinforcement_Learning

This project explores different approaches to solving games with large search spaces, such as Connect Four. 

Dynamic programming and Monte Carlo methods are effective for games with small search spaces, but may not perform well for larger games. 

Reinforcement learning, particularly deep Q-learning, is a more flexible and adaptable approach that can handle large search spaces and complex decision-making processes. 

The project also presents the results of training and simulating games between two deep Q-learning players using MLP and CNN.
